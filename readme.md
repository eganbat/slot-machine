For my project #1 I have built a simple slot-machine game.

What was your biggest challenge?
In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges that I had was thinking or being creative. In the middle of the project, I had to change my css and index few times trying to decide what looks and works best. 


What are your key learnings/takeaways?
