For my first project, I have built a simple slot-machinegame with a fun and colorful theme. There are three reels/boxes with values of cherry, lemon,and watermelon. Each image of the value will appear randomly per box. In this game, the logic is plain simple as if a player matches the same value in all three boxes, he or she wins instantly. 
In other words, 
    If a result of box one’s value matches with the result of box two’s and three’s values             
        “You have won” text appears
    Else           
        “Slot Machine” text appears.

What was your biggest challenge?
In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges that I had was thinking or being creative. In the middle of the project, I had to change my CSS and index a few times trying to decide what looks and works best.  

What are your key learnings/takeaways?
From this project, I realized that it is extremely important to plan out the wireframe before everything else otherwise end up changing a lot of things in the middle of the project.
